b56cebd Battery Bar [1/2]
494f279 Fix batteryBar on Navbar * this fixs the dual navbar battery bar when its supposed to be hidden and makes it work as intended * this also breaks statusbar tests need to spend some time solving this in java here https://github.com/PurifiedRom/android_frameworks_base/commit/39e80d24d28ac2026ff9dd3f7c832b6f489fe404#diff-ca2883aa3b534f5a1db5e0789780cf18R86 * proper fix would be to have it look for xmlns:systemui="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/com.android.systemui which is what the statusbar uses and xmlns:systemui="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto which is what navbar uses * we dont run statusbar tests so it isnt a big concern at the moment
